This is just a visualization for Sri Lankan Weekly Dengue Data.

Dengue Case Analysis in Sri Lanka
This project analyzes dengue case data in Sri Lanka to understand the spatial and temporal trends of the disease. The analysis uses a dataset containing weekly dengue case counts for different districts in Sri Lanka over several years.

Key Findings:

Yearly Trends: Visualizations reveal yearly fluctuations in dengue cases, with some years experiencing significantly higher case numbers than others.
District-wise Distribution: The analysis identifies districts with consistently high dengue burdens and highlights variations in case numbers across different regions of Sri Lanka.
Weekly Patterns: Exploration of weekly trends shows potential seasonality in dengue cases, with peaks possibly coinciding with monsoon seasons.
Interactive Mapping: An interactive bubble map allows users to explore the geographical distribution of cases over time by selecting specific years and weeks.
Heatmap Visualization: A heatmap provides a compact overview of weekly dengue cases by district, revealing patterns and hotspots.
Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics, including total cases, mean, median, range, and standard deviation, are calculated for each district to quantify the dengue burden.
Visualizations:
